        <p class="paes_title_text">The Dineen Coffee Co. opened its doors in Spring 2013 at the corner of famous Yonge Street and Temperance Street, in downtown Toronto. Our first cafe was built in the historic Dineen Building, once home to W. and F. Dineen Co., who originally
            made fur clothing. The building is one of the oldest structures in Toronto, and is listed as a Toronto Heritage Property. Since then, we have opened two additional locations in Toronto. One in the atrium of the venerable Commerce Court West
            office tower. The other is located at the corner of Gerrard Street East and Galt Avenue in Leslieville. At Dineen Coffee Co., we admire and cherish the historical significance of our location, and marry it with Toronto's contemporary lifestyle.
            Visit us and enjoy our coffee, food, and surroundings.</p>
